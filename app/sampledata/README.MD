# Calculator2

In this project, we added to the original calculator, by creating a landscape calculator 
with functions that include sine, cosine, tangent, log base 10, and natural log. 

## Functionality

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User sees a calculator in portrait mode. The user can rotate the phone to see the landscape mode calculator.
* [ ] User can calculate with the simple four functions in portrait mode. User can calculate with more functions using landscape mode.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

implementation("androidx.core:core-ktx:1.9.0") 
implementation("androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1")
implementation("com.google.android.material:material:1.9.0")
implementation("androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.4")
testImplementation("junit:junit:4.13.2")
androidTestImplementation("androidx.test.ext:junit:1.1.5") 
androidTestImplementation("androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.5.1")

## Notes

I had a hard time figuring out how to get to landscape mode. The xml file was pretty simple because
I already created one.
